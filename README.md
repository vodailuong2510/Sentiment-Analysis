# Sentiment-Analysis
# Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis using the IMDB dataset. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify movie reviews as positive or negative based on their sentiment.

# Dataset
The IMDB dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews, split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative. The dataset is preprocessed and tokenized to convert the text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.

# Model Architecture
The sentiment analysis model typically involves using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or transformer-based architectures like BERT. These models learn to extract features from text data and make predictions about the sentiment of the reviews. Techniques like attention mechanisms and transfer learning may be used to improve model performance.
